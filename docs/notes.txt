Blockchain
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of work tries to find the nonce that combined with the data (data + lastHash + timestamp) results in a hash with the number of leading zeros equal with difficulty level.
data + nonce = 000000eb29.....
difficulty = 6 (6 zeros)

Security
----------
If you decide to modify one block, you then need to modify all the blocks in the chain, because of the last hash dependency and the fact that the hash
of each block uses the last hash to compute its value. Essentially you have to mine again the whole chain with the new values. This is very expensive.
You could argue that by modifying the difficulty, mining will be cheaper, but the chain validation protects against jumps.

Crypto
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A blockchain powered cryptocurrency must:
1. Contain Wallet objects
2. Generate keys for digital signatures and verification
3. Have transactions objects representing currency exchange

Digital wallet composed of a private/public key pair and an address (which is a the same as public key).
Every transaction needs to be signed with the wallet's private key. It is decrypt with the wallets public key.

Transactions have 3 sections:
1. Input (timestamp, current balance of the sender wallet, the public key (sender's wallet address), the signature)
2. Output (destination wallet address with the amount that was sent to it; sender wallet address with the remaining amount)


Each block in the chain will contain 1 or more of this transaction objects.

The balance for a wallet is the output of their most recent transaction(the remaining amount) + the output of all the transactions that send money tho this wallet after the wallet's most recent transaction
