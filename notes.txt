Proof of work tries to find the nonce that combined with the data (data + lastHash + timestamp) results in a hash with the number of leading zeros equal with difficulty level.
data + nonce = 000000eb29.....
difficulty = 6 (6 zeros)

Security
----------
If you decide to modify one block, you then need to modify all the blocks in the chain, because of the last hash dependency and the fact that the hash
of each block uses the last hash to compute its value. Essentially you have to mine again the whole chain with the new values. This is very expensive.
You could argue that by modifying the difficulty, mining will be cheaper, but the chain validation protects against jumps.
